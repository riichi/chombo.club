Kraków Chombo Club (KCC; pol. Krakowski Klub Chombo, KKC) is an association located in Kraków, Lesser Poland, Poland. Our primary focus is Riichi (Japanese) Mahjong in the Lesser Poland region: promoting the game, developing and improving skills of the players in the region as well as collaborating with other Mahjong associations. It has been created in 2019 by a group of students from Jagiellonian University and has grown ever since.
