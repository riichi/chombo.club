      honba sticks) on the board and other players pay you 1000 each.

      2/1 extra han.

    * Before making your first discard, draw an extra tile and set it aside visible
      only for you.
        * On your turn, you may swap a tile from the closed part of your hand with
          that extra tile.
        * You may draw that tile instead of drawing from the wall.
            * You can take your extra tile instead of your rinshan draw. If you win
              on that tile, this would also count as rinshan kaihou yaku.

    </div>

    * Instead of your rinshan and ippatsu draws, reveal next 3 tiles from the wall.
      You may swap these with any dora indicators. Then put one into your hand and
      move remaining tiles to the end the live wall.
        * Ippatsu draw is a draw that can grant player victory with Ippatsu Tsumo.
          When ippatsu is broken by a call, the next draw of a player in riichi is
          considered a normal draw instead.
        * Rinshan draw is a draw that you get after making a kan that can grant
          player victory with Rinshan Kaihou.
    * Any kan you declare becomes concealed.
        * You can declare open kan even when she is in riichi if it doesn’t change
          her wait.
        * In case of a shouminkan(added kan) you can still win with chankan on it
          before it becomes closed. If a player doesn't win on it, but they could,
          they don't get furiten.
        * In case of a daminkana(open kana) the tile that was used for is exempt
          from furiten and doesn't break nagashi.
39. **Ryuumonbuchi Touka**

    * When you win with riichi, count your score as a dealer.

        * If you have exactly 0 han, count it as 1 han.
    * You may arrange dragon and wind tiles into sequences.
        * Sequences from honors don't give you additional fu.
        * Winds don;t wrap in sequences, e.g. you can't have a sequence with north,
          east and south.
      
      Example:

      instead. You must discard a different tile.

        <img src="/assets/images/cracow-saki-cards-taikai-2022/cards/ShimizudaniRyuuka.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    * Before making your first discard, set aside 10 extra tiles faceup and declare
      a yaku combination. Instead of drawing from the wall, draw tiles from those
      extras in any order. You can only win with no extra tiles left and only with
      exact declared yaku combination.
        * You can have more yaku in your hand, but they won't be taken into account
          when scoring.
        * To win, you need to have an exact combination of declared yaku. If you
          declare Menzen Tsumo yaku as a part of your combination and then win by
          ron, then it’s an illegal win.
    * Tsumo win gives you 1 han.
        * That bonus for tsumo win is awarded regardless of whether Menzen Tsumo
          yaku was declared or not.

              flip in your discards.
        * When you declare riichi, flip first two visible tiles in your discard
          facedown and switch to Himeko.

          extra turn, then switch to Mairu.
            * If you don't take the extra turn, you still switch to mairu.
        * When any player makes a call or declares riichi, switch to Mairu.

### General card clarifications

* Abilities that modify values of yaku are substitutive, not additive. “Pinfu
  gives you 2 han” means that for you the value of pinfu yaku is now 2 han
  instead of the usual 1 han.
* Many characters give you an additional han for something. These are bonuses,
  like the ones you get from dora. To win, you still need to have at least one
  yaku.
* Facedown tiles in discards are not counted for furiten, swapped tiles however
  can apply furiten.
* Facedown discards can be not be called, but can be ron’d if it is someone’s
  “always winning tile”. (e.g. Saki’s rinshan, Koromo’s houtei)
* A call from another player interrupts all abilities. For example, a player
  wouldn’t get an extra turn if their turn is interrupted by a call. A tile
  will not be swapped, if it gets called.
* All characters are always limited to 1 extra turn per normal turn, even if
  they fulfilled the condition for more extra turns.
* Extra turns are always optional. Player may decide to skip the extra turn and
  simply declare that their turn is over.
* Extra turns do not break ippatsu. That means that it is possible for some
  characters to effectively have 2 ippatsu draws.
* When ability opens additional dora indicators, riichi win will also have more
  uradora indicators. If there are no tiles left in the dead wall and you’re
  instructed to open additional dora indicator, move 2 tiles from the live wall
  into the dead wall, if possible.
* When players are instructed to bet more points than they have, they should
  bet as much as possible.
* Some cards can cause a hand from a player in riichi to become illegal by
  turning off their ability. You have to be extra careful. If in a result of
  that you have noten riichi hand you pay a reverse mangan penalty.
* When multiple players are tied for the last place the one farthest from the
  current dealer is considered to be in last place.
* If multiple players have the same priority level on a specific discard (e.g.
  Yukiko & Yuu), the player closest to the discarder takes the highest
  priority (atama hane).
* A tile can only be swapped if it was not called or ron’d by any player. When
  a tile is being swapped with a tile in the river, it cannot be called or
  declared ron by any player. The tile after swapping can apply or remove
  furiten respectively.
