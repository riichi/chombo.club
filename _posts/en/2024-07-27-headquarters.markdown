As some of you might already know, we've managed to secure our own place to play mahjong. Now it's time to share some details regarding regular meetings that'll be taking place there!

We'll be organizing two types of meetings — casual games and ranked games that'll count towards the USMA ranking run by our Silesian friends.

Details:
* Address: **ul. Studencka 6/8, 31-116 Kraków**

Terminy:
* **Casual/Teaching games** — **Tuesdays at 17:00** — everyone is welcome, especially beginners and those who would like to learn how to play mahjong. We'll teach you everything! We'll be creating events both [on our Discord server](https://discord.chombo.club/) and also on       [our Facebook Page](https://fb.me/chombo.club) so that it's easier for you to remember about the meetings. We'll also let you know in case a particular meeting is canceled.
  * **Ranked games** — **Thursdays at                               17:00** and **Saturdays at 16:00**. Anyone interested is welcome to visit [our Discord server](https://discord.chombo.club/).
