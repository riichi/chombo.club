It's time for the first chicken-flavored riichi tournament in Kraków!
The tournament will be held on 3rd April 2022 in [Boardowa Cafe](http://boardowa.pl/)
and will use modified [EMA](http://mahjong-europe.org/) rules. Additionally, the tournament
will be included in the [Upper-Silesian Mahjong Association](https://mahjongsilesia.wordpress.com/) ranking.

Below you will find all the tournament details and the link to the registration form.
We accept new participants until 20th March, but we'd like to accept sign-ups as fast as possible
in order to be able to estimate the number of participants.

Every registered participant gets a cup of instant ramen for DIY preparation + multi-use chopsticks for eating the ramen. ❤️

## Rules

The ruleset is **EMA 2016 with the following modifications:**

### Bird of Honor
1s is counted as one of souzu *or* an active honor depending on what gives a greater score. This means the following:

* A pair of 1s can give 2 fu for an active honor pair (it blocks pinfu this way);
* 1s is neither a dragon nor a wind, so it cannot replace any in shousangen/daisangen lub shousuushii/daisuushii;
* A koutsu or kantsu from 1s can count as **fanpai kura** (see below).

### Additional yaku: fanpai kura (蔵)
* Koutsu albo kantsu from 1s treated as honors.
* Valid for winning via tsumo or ron.
* Worth 1 han.

### Additional yaku: kinkei dokuritsu (金鶏独立)
* Four melded groups + single wait (hadaka tanki) on 1s.
* Valid for winning via tsumo or ron.
* Always worth 5 han (mangan), does not mesh with other yaku.

### Yakitori

* Penalty for not winning a single hand during the whole hanchan.
* Worth -10000 points, counted before uma.

### Examples

{% capture fig_hand1 %}
![111123444m6z_6z_111*s]({{ "/assets/images/2022-02-15-instant-ramen-taikai-hand1.png" | relative_url }})

The hand above is a honitsu in manzu + fanpai kura.

{% capture fig_hand2 %}
![111s333s9s_9s_4*56s_7*65s]({{ "/assets/images/2022-02-15-instant-ramen-taikai-hand2.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_hand2 | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
</figure>

This hand does not use the bird of honor rule, because then it would count only as honitsu + kura;
instead, this hand is a "standard" chinitsu in souzu.

{% capture fig_hand3 %}
![111s1z_1z_4*44z_55*5**5z_7*77z]({{ "/assets/images/2022-02-15-instant-ramen-taikai-hand3.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_hand3 | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
</figure>

This hand is yakuman tsuuiisou.

{% capture fig_hand4 %}
![123345678m11s34s_2s]({{ "/assets/images/2022-02-15-instant-ramen-taikai-hand4.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_hand4 | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
</figure>

If we count the 1s as pair as a honor pair, we get 2 fu.
It is better to instead count it as a pair of normal files, which gets us pinfu.

{% capture fig_hand5 %}
![1s_1s_2*34m_555*z_7*77s_8*79p]({{ "/assets/images/2022-02-15-instant-ramen-taikai-hand5.png" | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_hand5 | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
</figure>

If this hand contains no dora, then it's kinkei dokuritsu, worth a mangan.
If both white dragon and 7s are dora, then we instead count it as haku dora6 (haneman).
