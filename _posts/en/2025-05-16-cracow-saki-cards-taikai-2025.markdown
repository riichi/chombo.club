### Kazoe Yakuman

A hand worth 13 han or more is treated as a yakuman.

### Additional yaku: Nagashi Mangan (流し満貫)

* Awarded if during a ryuukyoku (exhaustive draw) the player meets all of the following:
  * All visible discards are terminals (1s, 9s) or honors
  * None of the player's discards were called
  * Player has a closed hand

* Always worth 5 han (mangan), does not combine with other yaku or dora.

### Red Fives

There are 3 red fives in the game, one per suit.

### Saki Cards 1.3

Before the game starts, the first dealer gives each player 7 cards from the deck.
Each player chooses one card, then passes the remaining cards to the player on their right. This continues until everyone has 6 cards. The rest are discarded.

Players then select 1 of their 6 cards after seeing their starting hand and place it face-down. Once everyone is ready, they reveal their chosen cards.

There are 63 cards in the deck, each with a unique ability.
