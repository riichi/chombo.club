YouTube lacks high-quality tutorials about Mahjong for beginners, especially in Polish. Newcomers that want to play this chinese game are therefore forced to watch videos in English or read text guides in Polish that are often not very great. A person who is completely new to the game that does not have anyone that could help them may easily be discouraged and never come back.

We have decided to fix this problem and create a series of videos that shows step by step how to play Rīchi Mahjong. In the first episode: the contents of the tileset and recognizing the tiles — already available on [Kraków Chombo Club's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCsyYLtIHOPfZtL1o-iNzNA). English subtitles included! Expect next episodes in the following weeks.
