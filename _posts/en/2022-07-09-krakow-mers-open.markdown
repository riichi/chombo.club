## How to get to the tournament

  <img style="float: right; width: 400px; max-width: 100%;" src="/assets/images/mers-2022-map.png" alt="Commute map"/>
</a>

Generally speaking, we recommend taking a tram.
Depending on your exact location, the connection can be direct, or may require
you to change the tram on one of the stops.
The stop you should arrive at is named **Ruczaj** and the following trams will
take you there from the main train station:
* Tram 52, direct connection with around 22 minutes of commute time
* Tram 3 &#8594; 18, also ~22 minutes of time, but includes a change of tram
* Tram 50 &#8594; 17, longer commute time (32 minutes) due to the route

After leaving the tram, it will be just a 5 minute walk to arrive at the final
destination (Jagiellonian University, Faculty of Mathematics and Information
Technologies).

If you want to drop by a shop, we can recommend getting off 1 stop earlier, on
the **Norymberska** stop. There is a supermarket just next to the stop.
(Due to Polish law, it will be fully closed on Sunday)
In case you need more detailed instructions, you can use
<https://krakow.jakdojade.pl> or <https://maps.google.com> &mdash; both
offer free help in Polish and English.
