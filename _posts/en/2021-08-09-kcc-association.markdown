We’ve made it — on July 29, 2021 the Krakow Chombo Club has officially become an association. It’s the pinnacle of a nearly two-year process — one year of playing together and planning the future, and another which we devoted to the formal process and developing the idea of the association. We hope that this official form of association will let us organize better events and help our members represent our region much easier, both domestically and internationally. It’s not the end of our work now though! We are planning our first big event already — a tournament in Kraków, which will most likely take place in the last quarter of this year.

If you are interested in becoming a member of Krakow Chombo Club Association or organizing something together with us, please contact us via our [Facebook fanpage](https://fb.me/chombo.club) or [Discord server](https://discord.chombo.club).
