## How to get there

  <img style="float: right; width: 400px; max-width: 100%;" src="/assets/images/mers-2026-map.png" alt="Commute map" />
</a>

Generally speaking, we recommend taking a tram. The nearest stop to the tournament venue is **Zabłocie**. Below are example tram connections from the **Main Railway Station**:

* **Tram 50** from stop **Dworzec Główny Tunel**, direct connection with around 10 minutes of commute time
* **Tram 20**  from stop **Teatr Słowackiego**, also around 10 minutes of commute time

After leaving the tram, the building is located right next to the stop — you only need to cross the road.
There are many convenience stores in the area, and if larger shopping is needed, Galeria Kazimierz is located nearby, where there is a Carrefour store. (Please note that due to Polish law, the store will be closed on **Sunday, 15 February**. The convenience stores remain open.)
