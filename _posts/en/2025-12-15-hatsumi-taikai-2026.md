</a>

We recommend taking a tram or bus to the venue — the nearest stop is **Ruczaj**.
Example tram connections from the Main Railway Station (stop **Teatr Słowackiego**):
* Tram 52, approx. 22 minutes,
* Tram 3 &#8594; 18, approx. 22 minutes but requires a transfer,
* Tram 50 &#8594; 17, approx. 32 minutes due to a longer route.

After leaving the stop, it is about a five-minute walk to the venue.

There is a Kaufland supermarket nearby (about a 5-minute walk) — you can get off one stop earlier at **Norymberska**.
Please note that it will be closed on Sunday.

Free parking is also available at the venue.
