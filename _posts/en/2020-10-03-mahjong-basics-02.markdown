The second episode of our series describing the rīchi mahjong basics landed on the
[YouTube channel of Kraków Chombo Club.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCsyYLtIHOPfZtL1o-iNzNA).
We show how to properly prepare the game, that is: seat the players, prepare the wall, deal point sticks, and draw the starting hands.

The next, third episode, will happen soon!
